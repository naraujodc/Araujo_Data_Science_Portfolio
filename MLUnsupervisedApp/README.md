This project is an interactive app that invites the user to explore three different unsupervised machine learning methods:
**Principal Component Analysis** for dimensionality reduction, **K-Means Clustering**, and **Hierarchical Clustering**.
The user is able to:
- Upload their own dataset or choose from three demo datasets;
- Navigate between the three unsupervised ML models;
- Select different hyperparameters for each model, such as the k number of clusters and linkage method;
- Visualize the model outputs in different ways, including **scatterplots**, **biplots**, **scree plots**, **dendrograms**, and more;
- Read explanations about each aspect of the models, including the hyperparameters, metrics, and visuals shown, as well as the data preprocessing steps.
- View the first observations of their chosen dataset and its summary statistics, as well as short descriptions of the demo datasets.

The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive experience and enhance the user's understanding of unsupervised machine learning models.
My goal was to make the app as self-contained as possible, so there are answers to common questions that may show up and
explanations about the model outputs and visualizations within the app. This project showcases my knowledge of unsupervised machine learning
methods for dimensionality reduction and clustering and demonstrates my ability to interpret outputs and tune hyperparameters.

### Behind the App
Many computations happen in the background to ensure that the users can navigate the app smoothly and without error.
I highly recommend checking the code in this repository to see some of the strategies I used to guarantee that the code runs
without errors independently of the order in which users interact with the buttons.
